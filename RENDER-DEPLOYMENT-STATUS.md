# Render Deployment Status

## Issue: Deployments Not Updating

### Problem
- API endpoints work correctly
- Root domain shows 404 
- Code changes not reflecting on live server
- Last updated timestamp shows old deployment

### Diagnosis
1. ✅ Git commits are being pushed successfully
2. ✅ Repository is connected to GitHub
3. ❌ Render auto-deployment appears to be stalled or disconnected
4. ❌ Live server not updating with new code

### Next Steps
1. Check Render dashboard for deployment status
2. Verify webhook connection between GitHub and Render
3. Consider manual deployment trigger
4. Possibly recreate Render service if auto-deployment is broken

### Current Status
- Custom domain: crm.gandhibaideaddictioncenter.com
- Server status: Running but outdated code
- API endpoints: Working
- Frontend: 404 (should show embedded HTML)

**Last deployment attempt:** August 29, 2025
**Status:** Deployment pipeline appears disconnected
